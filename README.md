# Drawer Maker

A Window's Paint Alternative That Can Be Used Within Your Browser!

## Description

Have you ever uninstalled that built-in Paint Application that came with your PC by accident??

I haven't but millions of people uninstall Apps everday, so what are the chances that someone accidentally does?

Well, fear not, fellow reader, for I have engineered the revolutionary Paint Application that no one has asked for!

Introducing DrawerMaker!

And no, it doesn't make drawers for your clothes or drawers for you to wear.

Not yet, at least.....

But what it does do, is make a great substitute for that lame Paint Application that everyone forgets they have.

Need to change the length of your lines. DrawerMaker has got you covered!

Need to save your drawing that you built on DrawerMaker so that you can finally show your 5 year old nephew that you're the superior artist?

Guess what, DrawerMaker has got you covered!
